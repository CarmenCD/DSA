# SOLID Design Principles
### [S - Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

### [O - Open / Close Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
Software entities should be open for extention, but close for modification
### [L - Liskov substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program

### [I - Interface Segragation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
Many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility

### [D - Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
